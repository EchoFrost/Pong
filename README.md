# Pong

### Description
A pong-esque game developed in Unity.

### Download Instructions
From the GitHub repository, click the "Clone or download" button to begin acquiring the game files. If you have the GitHub desktop client you can select "Open in Desktop" to begin cloning the repository. Otherwise select "Download ZIP". After cloning the repository through the GitHub desktop client or after extracting the zipped files, you can begin playing the game by navigating to the "Builds" folder, and opening the executable Pong.exe.

### Development
If you wish to open the project files, make sure you have Unity 2018.2.5f1 or later installed. On the project selection screen on Unity startup, simply select the top level folder of your cloned repository.

### Gameplay
The game will give you instruction on how to move, but in case you want a head start- you can move your character "up" with the "w" key. You can move your character "down" with the "s" key. You are the leftmost rectangular paddle, and the ball will always serve to you after a 2 second delay.

### NOTE: The game may not function well on low aspect ratios! If you can not see your paddles during gameplay change your display resolution! 16:9 works best!
